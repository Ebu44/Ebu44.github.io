## Who are you?

I'm Ebubekir (but you can call me Ebu because it is easy to say). I'm a Computer Engineer who likes to develop software. Furthermore, I love computer games as much as I love software. If you want to find me, here's my Steam friend code: 124184651.

## What does this website contain?

I am working on developments in Web Development, Data Science and Machine Learning. I gather information from various sources and write blog posts to create resources for myself and others. So, if you have any questions or issues, feel free to email me.
